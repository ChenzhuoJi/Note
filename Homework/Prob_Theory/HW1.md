**Problem.1**
(a): There are 26 letters and 10 numbers for each place. So the number is $26^2\times 10^5$

(b):This is a permutation problem. The number is $A_{26}^2* A_{10}^5$

**Problem.2**
(a):$A_8^8=8!$

(b):See A & B as a whole.Then the row includs 7 "persons" and there are $A_2^2$ arrangements in A&B. The final anwser is:  
$$
A_7^7\times A_2^2
$$

(c):First we put the men in a row, and then put women in the gaps of men(both ends can also be placed).
$$
A_4^4\times C_5^4\times A_4^4
$$

(d):Like (b), the anwser is $A_5^5\times A_4^4$ . 

(e): $(A_2^2)^4\times A_4^4$

**Problem.3**
$(3x^2+y)^5=(3x^2)^5+5(3x^2)^4y+10(3x^2)^3y^2+10(3x^2)^2y^3+5(3x^2)y^4+y^5$

**Problem.4**
